With 10 days left before the closing date, South African media are invited to submit their entries for the 2018 SADC Media Awards competition. The Awards were established following a decision by the Council of Ministers in 1996 to establish a sector that deals with matters relating to amongst others, information, culture and sport. These awards serve as part of ensuring a link, coordination and synchronisation between formal structures of SADC governments, civil society, academia, labour and the media. To promote regional integration and cooperation (cross-border issues), the awards aim to recognise excellence in journalism in the area of print, photo, television, radio as well as to encourage media practitioners in member states to cover issues pertaining to the region. Journalists who wish to enter the competition can access more information about the competition, including competition rules, from the link below: Entry Form- https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_documents/Entry_ form_English.pdf Rules - https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_documents/2018_Rules_of_Competition_English.pdf                                         Entries need to be posted or delivered to MDDA or GCIS offices marked:SADC Media Awards Entry                 or               SADC Media Awards EntryMDDA – 1ST Floor                                                  Government Communications5 St Davids Place                                                    1035 Francis Baard StreetParktown, Johannesburg                                      Hatfield, Pretoria2193                                                                         0028 For enquiries, please contact:Mr William BaloyiCell: 083 3907 147 Ms. Mmemme MogotsiCell: 072 856 4288
