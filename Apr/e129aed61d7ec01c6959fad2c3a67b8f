11 April 2018 Statement on Winne Madikizela-Mandela Official Memorial Service Government thanks South Africans for participating in the official memorial service at the Orlando Stadium in remembering and celebrating the life of struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The decorum shown during the memorial service and the vibrant manner in which Mama Winnie Madikzela-Mandela was honoured is a true reflection of the love for the “Mother of our Nation”. The memorial service was broadcast live across all television and radio stations, including community radio, allowing South Africans in every part of the country to join the celebration of her life. “Today we honoured in jubilant celebration the life of the mother of our nation. In paying tribute to Mama Winnie, South Africans displayed the true spirit of Ubuntu which is the heart of our democracy,” said Acting GCIS Director-General Ms Phumla Williams. The country owes Mama Winnie a great debt of gratitude for the role she played in the struggle for liberation and for the many sacrifices she had made so that all South Africans enjoy the precious freedom we have today. The period of mourning declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa continues until 14 April 2018 when Mama Winnie will be laid to rest in a Special Official Funeral that will also be held at Orlando Stadium. Over the next two days let us all continue to share our fond memories and pay tribute to Mama Winnie. Books of condolence remain accessible, nationally and at our diplomatic missions.
